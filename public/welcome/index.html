    This game uses images and information from iNaturalist.org.  Just match a pair of pictures and you're on your way!

    Click on the Game link, then choose which species you want the pictures to be.

    Check out the sidebar to keep track of your guesses and how many you got right.  You can click on the inaturalist hyperlink
    to see the current photo on the inaturalist.org website.
